# Basic-Banking-System
An implementation of Basic Banking System using HTML-CSS-JS.

Even though I was selected as a Data Science & Business Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation under their #GRIPDEC20 program, I still gave a try to a task from Web Development domain just for the purpose of exploration in other fields.

So, in this task I have developed a Basic Banking System which stores the list of customers and allows us to transfer money among the available customers while maintaining a transaction record. I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to implement this.
